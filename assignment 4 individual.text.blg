This is BibTeX, Version 0.99dThe top-level auxiliary file: assignment 4 individual.text.aux
I couldn't open style file IEEEtran.bst
---line 13 of file assignment 4 individual.text.aux
 : \bibstyle{IEEEtran
 :                   }
I'm skipping whatever remains of this command
I found no style file---while reading file assignment 4 individual.text.aux
(There were 2 error messages)
